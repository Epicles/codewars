# This time no story, no theory. The examples below show you how to write function accum:
#
# Examples:
# accum("abcd") -> "A-Bb-Ccc-Dddd"
# accum("RqaEzty") -> "R-Qq-Aaa-Eeee-Zzzzz-Tttttt-Yyyyyyy"
# accum("cwAt") -> "C-Ww-Aaa-Tttt"
# The parameter of accum is a string which includes only letters from a..z and A..Z.


# My solutions
def accum(s):
    answ = list()
    for i in range(len(s)):
        answ.append((s[i] * (i + 1)).capitalize())
    return '-'.join(answ)
